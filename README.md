file to describe your project, including instructions for building and 
running the project, pointers to the license under which you are making the

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give 
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
